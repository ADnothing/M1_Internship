Note (1): Positions from PyBDSF or combination of PyBDSF components.
Note (2): Posiiton errors estimated by PyBDSF. Only fitting uncertainties are
  included.
Note (3): Code as follows:
  S = indicates an isolated source that is fit with a single Gaussian
  C = represents sources that are fit by a single Gaussian but are within an
       island of emission that also contains other sources
  M = is used for sources with are extended and fit with multiple Gaussians
  

I converted the catalog.dat to a catalog.csv, then I save the data in npz files
that I can load separately the files and avoid memory issue.

names.npz : Source_Name
positions.npz : RA, E_RA, DEC, E_DEC
flux.npz : Peak_flux, EPeakflux, Total_flux, ETotalflux
dim.npz : Maj, E_Maj, Min, E_Min, DC_Maj, EDCMaj, DC_Min, EDCMin 
PA.npz : PA, E_PA, DC_PA, EDCPA
mosaic.npz : Isl_rms, S_Code, Mosaic_ID, Number_Pointings, Masked_Fraction

No need to dowload the catalog, you can find directly the npz files in this repository.
