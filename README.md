Parameters of the catalog are explored in the notebook "Catalog_analysis.ipynb".

You can find the catalog in : https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/A+A/659/A1/

All the explanations are in the file : Info

The catalog is too heavy for GitHub, if you want to run the Notebook "Catalog_analysis.ipynb" You should download the catalog on your own and maybe modify the way the data are stored and called.
